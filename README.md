# Peter Gormley

Hi! My name is Peter Gormley! Welcome to my Github.io page!

I am a Statistics and Economics dual degree junior at [Lehigh Unversity](http://www1.lehigh.edu/). This site was created to display the work I am doing in my Data Visualization class in the [Department of Journalism and Communication](https://journalism.cas2.lehigh.edu/).

At Lehigh, I am involved in a variety of ways. I am the president of my fraternity Kappa Sigma, the founder and president of the Sports Analytics Club, and I was an assistant sports editor for the Lehigh student newspaper [The Brown and White](http://thebrownandwhite.com/).

This upcoming summer, I will be an Investment Banking Summer Analyst for Citigroup in New York City. Last summer, I was an analyst for [Phoenix Marketing International](http://phoenixmi.com/), a market research firm based in Warrington, Pennsylvania. 

[Here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-gormley-ba248210b) is my LinkedIn page.
